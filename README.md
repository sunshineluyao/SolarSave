# **SolarChain: Blockchain for Sustainable Energy Optimization**

## **Overview**

**SolarChain** is an open-source platform for urban distributed-energy verification and blockchain-backed solar asset registration. It combines geospatial interaction, physics-bounded solar modeling, planner review, wallet-signed on-chain registration, factory-side energy demand, and a simulator-driven market update flow.

SolarChain is designed as an interactive decision-support tool for urban planners, energy communities, and researchers. The machine computes physical generation boundaries; the human reviews candidate distributed-energy-resource (DER) samples; approved candidates are cryptographically signed through MetaMask before becoming on-chain solar panels.

Project naming note: the product name is **SolarChain**, while the repository/folder name remains `SolarSave`.

## **EIoT Research Positioning**

For EIoT-style evaluation, SolarChain is framed as **SolarAgents**: a
physics-grounded embodied-IoT coordination testbed for verifiable urban solar
energy systems. Each distributed PV node is represented as a lightweight
embodied agent with physical attributes, environmental perception, generation
reporting behavior, verification history, trust state, calibration memory, and
market feedback. The blockchain layer is used as a verifiable settlement and
audit layer after physical verification and planner review, rather than as the
sole research contribution.

The EIoT experiment suite covers:

- Closed-loop monthly agent episodes over 50 embodied PV agents and 720 hourly
  coordination steps.
- Persistent event, audit, connected-system, decision, market, and agent-state
  traces with hash-chained records.
- FDIA attack taxonomy, adaptive verification, reward/liquidity ratio sweep,
  system-overhead measurement, and scale projection experiments.


## **Key Features**

### **Planner Decision Console**
- **Candidate DER Queue**: Load hourly urban solar samples from CSV and review machine-checked records in a planner-facing queue.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Verification**: Compare reported power against the physics maximum (`P_max_W`) before approving or rejecting a candidate.
- **Audit Trail**: Track machine computation, planner review, wallet signature, and on-chain registration in one workflow.

### **Interactive Map and Asset Creation**
- **Candidate DER Samples**: Display imported DER records as map markers grouped by `node_id`.
- **Solar Panel Registration**: Convert approved candidates, or manually selected coordinates, into on-chain solar panels.
- **Factory Registration**: Register factories with location and power consumption to model energy demand on-chain.
- **Layer Controls**: Toggle candidate DER samples, on-chain solar panels, and factory demand nodes.

### **Physics-Bounded Generation Verification**
- **Prediction API Integration**: Uses the simulator API to predict panel values such as battery temperature, DC power, and AC power for selected locations.
- **Boundary-Based Validation**: Imported records include `P_max_W`, `P_reported_W`, FDIA labels, and verification status.
- **Planner Review Before Submission**: Panel registration requires explicit planner approval before the MetaMask signature and on-chain transaction.

### **On-Chain Energy Market**
- **Supply and Demand Tracking**: Maintains global supply energy and total market demand on-chain.
- **Factory Energy Purchase**: Buy energy for a selected factory using SOLR, with on-chain cost preview.
- **Factory Energy Balances**: Track per-factory energy balance and deficits in the UI.
- **Market Impact View**: Compare verified SolarChain liquidity against a no-split baseline and inspect slippage reduction.

### **Rewards and Cooldown Logic**
- **Personal Reward Accrual**: Rewards accumulate from simulator market steps.
- **Claim with Cooldown**: Reward claiming respects `simulatorStepSeconds` cooldown logic from the contract.
- **Live Reward Preview**: Frontend previews claimable rewards before submission.

### **Wallet and Token Operations**
- **MetaMask Integration**: Connect wallet and interact with contracts through ethers.js.
- **SOLR Transfers**: Transfer SOLR between addresses from the wallet UI.
- **Owner Mint Tools (Local/Test)**: Token owner can mint SOLR for local testing workflows.

## **Dataset & Research Enablement**

SolarChain includes a reproducible, multi-city simulation dataset under
`Simulator/data/datasets_2026_04_month/`. The EIoT benchmark dataset covers a
one-month hourly episode from `2026-04-01` to `2026-05-01` in
`Asia/Shanghai`, combines `pvlib` solar modeling with
Open-Meteo historical weather observations, and injects exactly 5% FDIA
records for anomaly-detection benchmarking.

Generate or refresh the dataset:

```bash
conda run -n SolarSave python Simulator/data/generate_monthly_datasets.py
```

Generate the reviewer and canonical research figures:

```bash
conda run -n SolarSave python Simulator/data/visualizations.py
```

### **Frontend Dataset Import**

The planner workbench reads static CSV files from
`client/public/datasets_2026_04_month/` by default. Override this with
`VITE_URBAN_DATASET_DIR` if you want the frontend to load another public CSV
folder.

| Frontend File | Used For |
|---------------|----------|
| `client/public/datasets_2026_04_month/spatiotemporal_generation.csv` | Candidate DER queue, map markers, physics-boundary review, FDIA status |
| `client/public/datasets_2026_04_month/market_liquidity.csv` | Market Impact view and SolarChain-vs-baseline liquidity comparison |

To update the client-side candidate data, replace those CSV files and refresh the frontend.
The queue displays all hourly records from `spatiotemporal_generation.csv`; the map groups
those records by `node_id`, so 720 hourly samples for one DER node appear as one location
marker. Approved candidates can be converted into on-chain solar panels through the
planner review and MetaMask signature workflow.

Important planner metrics:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Verified DER** | Candidate records whose machine verification status is `verified`. |
| **Rejected FDIA** | Candidate records rejected by the physics-boundary check. |
| **On-chain** | Candidates registered as blockchain solar panels during the current client session. |
| **Ready MW** | Verified, non-rejected generation estimate, computed from `min(P_reported_W, P_max_W)` and converted from W to MW. |

### **Research Enablement**

**Urban Resilience**  
Urban-computing and resilience researchers can use `urban_energy_nodes.csv` and
`spatiotemporal_generation.csv` to evaluate whether DER nodes are distributed
reasonably across dense urban regions. Useful visual diagnostics include
geospatial DER distribution maps, city-level node-density plots, installed
capacity bubble maps, spatio-temporal heatmaps by city and hour, and intra-city
generation boxplots. These figures help assess whether solar capacity is
clustered too heavily in one city, whether generation diversity improves
resilience during low-irradiance hours, and whether specific cities show
abnormal volatility that could weaken local energy reliability.

**Incentive Mechanisms**  
Economists and market-design researchers can extract trade and liquidity
variables from `p2p_trades.csv` and `market_liquidity.csv` to test alternative
token policies. Key variables include `energy_purchased_MW`, `tokens_burned`,
`exergy_dissipated_MJ`, `total_verified_MW`, `solarchain_liquidity_MW`,
`baseline_liquidity_MW`, `slippage_solarchain_pct`, and
`slippage_baseline_pct`. These records support counterfactual analysis of burn
rates, liquidity incentives, slippage controls, and the effect of SolarChain's
configurable reward/liquidity split compared with a baseline.

**FDIA Anomaly Detection**  
Machine-learning researchers can treat `spatiotemporal_generation.csv` as a
supervised benchmark for false-data injection detection. `P_max_W` provides a
physics-based upper bound, while `P_reported_W`, `irradiance_Wm2`, `air_temp_C`,
`hour`, city, and node metadata provide model features. The `fdia_detected`
column is the ground-truth classification label, and `verification_status`
records the system-level decision. A typical pipeline is to split records by
node or city to avoid leakage, train classifiers on physical residuals such as
`P_reported_W - P_max_W` or ratios such as `P_reported_W / P_max_W`, and validate
precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, and false-rejection rates against the labeled
FDIA samples.

The visualization script already produces eight English-language PNG figures
covering reviewer-response plots and canonical urban-computing figures:

| Figure | Output File |

| Theoretical generation vs reported generation with rejected FDIA points | `Simulator/data/visualizations/reviewer_a_generation_vs_reported_fdia.png` |
| Liquidity depth comparison: selected SolarChain split vs baseline | `Simulator/data/visualizations/reviewer_a_liquidity_depth_comparison.png` |
| Spatio-temporal heatmap | `Simulator/data/visualizations/canonical_01_spatiotemporal_heatmap.png` |

## **Installation and Running**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Node.js**: 18+ (LTS recommended)
- **Python**: 3.9+ (3.10 recommended)
- **Git**: latest
- **MetaMask**: for local wallet interactions
- **npm**: comes with Node.js (used by `client/` and `smart_contract/`)

### **2. Clone the Project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GreenComp-ERC/SolarSave.git
cd SolarSave
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Smart contracts:
```bash
cd ../smart_contract
npm install
```

Simulator:
```bash
cd ../Simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Optional Environment Variables**
Create `.env` in `smart_contract/` if you want to customize deployment behavior:

```env
# Optional: simulator update interval written to contracts and Simulator/.env
SIMULATOR_STEP_SECONDS=60

# Optional: token airdrop and reward pool setup
AIRDROP_AMOUNT=1000
REWARD_FUND_AMOUNT=10000

# Optional: explicit private key for simulator sync (0x...)
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=
SIMULATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

Notes:
- If keys are omitted in local Hardhat mode, deploy script tries to derive from default Hardhat mnemonic.
- Contract addresses are auto-written to frontend files during deployment.

### **5. Start Local Blockchain**
```bash
cd ../smart_contract
npx hardhat node
```

### **6. Deploy Contracts (Local Hardhat)**
In a second terminal:
```bash
cd smart_contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deployAll.js --network localhost
```

This script also:
- Authorizes the Shop contract in SolarPanels
- Airdrops SOLR to local accounts
- Funds the PowerReward pool
- Syncs `Simulator/.env` for the simulator

The deployment scripts write addresses to:
- `smart_contract/scripts/contractAddress.json`
- `client/src/utils/contractAddress.json` (auto-synced for the frontend)

### **7. Start the Simulator**
```bash
cd ../Simulator
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Default API URL used by frontend: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### **8. Start the Frontend**
In another terminal:
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Default frontend URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### **9. Local Run Checklist (Recommended Order)**
Run these in separate terminals:

1. `smart_contract`: `npx hardhat node`
2. `smart_contract`: `npx hardhat run scripts/deployAll.js --network localhost`
3. `Simulator`: `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`
4. `client`: `npm run dev`

Then in MetaMask:
- Add local chain `http://127.0.0.1:8545`, chain ID `31337`
- Import a local Hardhat test account key for development only

### **10. MetaMask (Private Chain / Server)**
For private-chain deployment on a server, users should manually add a custom network in MetaMask:

- Network Name: `SolarChain Private`
- RPC URL: `https://<your-domain-or-ip>/rpc`
- Chain ID: `<your-private-chain-id>`
- Currency Symbol: `<native-gas-token-symbol>`
- Block Explorer URL: optional

Notes:
- The `Chain ID` in MetaMask must exactly match the node's configured chain ID.
- Use HTTPS RPC in production and ensure public access from user browsers.
- Do not share or import server/operator private keys into user wallets.
- Ensure users have enough native gas token to submit transactions.
- Frontend contract addresses must be the server-deployed addresses (not localhost addresses).

Local development fallback (Hardhat):
- Network: `Hardhat Local`
- RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- Chain ID: `31337`
- Import a Hardhat test account private key only for local testing

---

## **Troubleshooting**
- **`npx hardhat node` exits with code 1**:
   - Make sure you are inside `smart_contract/`.
   - Run `npm install` in `smart_contract/` first.
   - Check if port `8545` is already in use (stop the existing process or change port).

- **`npm run dev` exits with code 1 in `client/`**:
   - Ensure `npm install` was executed in `client/`.
   - Confirm Node.js version is 18+ (`node -v`).
   - If port `3000` is occupied, free it or change `server.port` in `client/vite.config.js`.

- **Frontend cannot call simulator API**:
   - Ensure simulator is running on `127.0.0.1:8000`.
   - Client components use `VITE_SOLAR_AGENT_API` and default to `http://localhost:8000`.

- **Candidate DER Queue is empty**:
   - Ensure `client/public/datasets_2026_04_month/spatiotemporal_generation.csv` exists, or set `VITE_URBAN_DATASET_DIR` to the folder you want to load.
   - Confirm the CSV header matches the documented dataset fields.
   - Refresh the frontend after replacing CSV files.

- **Map shows fewer candidate markers than queue rows**:
   - This is expected: the queue shows hourly samples, while the map groups samples by `node_id`.
   - For the bundled monthly dataset, 36,000 hourly records become 50 DER node markers.

- **Approve opens registration but MetaMask does not sign**:
   - Ensure MetaMask is connected to the expected local/private chain.
   - Ensure the connected account has enough native gas token and SOLR for the local registration flow.

- **Global Supply / Global Demand is 0**: make sure the simulator is running and that at least one solar panel and factory are created on-chain.
- **Rewards are 0**: the energy simulator must run at least one step to update the market and reward balances.
- **Next update stuck at 0m 0s or countdown jumps**:
   - Ensure `Simulator/.env` has a valid `SIMULATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` and `ENABLE_ENERGY_SIM=true`.
   - The simulator now syncs contract `simulatorStepSeconds` from `SIMULATOR_STEP_SECONDS` at startup.
   - Restart simulator after changing `SIMULATOR_STEP_SECONDS`.

## **How to Use SolarChain**

1. **Connect Wallet and Load Contracts**:
   - Open the frontend application.
   - Connect MetaMask to the local Hardhat network.

2. **Review Candidate DER Samples**:
   - Open the Planner Decision Console.
   - Use the left-side Planner Workbench to inspect verification metrics and toggle data layers.
   - Select an hourly record from Candidate DER Queue or click a DER marker on the map.

3. **Approve, Reject, or Convert a Candidate**:
   - Review irradiance, air temperature, `P_max_W`, reported power, residual, and risk status.
   - Reject suspicious FDIA records without sending an on-chain transaction.
   - Approve trusted candidates and use the Planner Review & Registration window to sign and register them as on-chain solar panels.

4. **Create Manual Solar Panels and Factories**:
   - Right-click the map to manually create a solar panel or register a factory.
   - Manual panel creation still uses simulator prediction data and now passes through planner review before wallet signature.
   - Factory registration saves location and consumption for demand-side market modeling.

5. **Run Market Updates with Simulator**:
   - Start the simulator to generate/update panel output.
   - Let the simulator update market supply, demand, and personal rewards.

6. **Trade and Allocate Energy**:
   - Use the market dashboard to inspect global supply/demand.
   - Purchase energy for factories and monitor factory balances.
   - Use Market Impact to compare verified SolarChain liquidity with the no-split baseline.

7. **Claim Rewards and Manage SOLR**:
   - Claim personal rewards when cooldown allows.
   - Manage SOLR balances and transfers through wallet UI.
